            At <strong>AutoParts Direct</strong>, we are committed to ensuring customer satisfaction by providing high-quality products 
            and reliable service. We understand that sometimes returns and refunds are necessary, and we aim to make the process as

        <p class="refund-text">
            If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, you may request a refund within <strong>30 days</strong> of the 
            purchase date. To qualify for a refund, the item must be in its original condition, unused, and returned in the 
            original packaging. Please include a copy of your receipt or proof of purchase to facilitate the return process.

            Refunds will be processed once the returned item has been received and inspected. If the return meets our requirements, 
            a refund will be issued to your original payment method within <strong>5-10 business days</strong>. Please note that 
            shipping fees are non-refundable, and customers are responsible for return shipping costs unless the return is due 
            to a product defect or an error on our part.
